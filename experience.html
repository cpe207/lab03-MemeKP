                    The game I like to play the most is Genshin Impack. It is an action role-playing game developed by
                    miHoYo. Genshin Impact takes place in the fantasy world of Teyvat, home to seven nations,
                    each of which is tied to a different element and ruled by a different god (archon).
                    The story follows The Traveler, an interstellar adventurer who, at the start of the game, is
                    separated from their twin sibling after the two land in Teyvat.

                    During my free time, I enjoy cooking at home with my sister. It's true that sometimes it turns out
                    well and sometimes it doesn't.
                    Cooking allows me to relax and have fun.

                <dt>Drawing</dt>
                <dd>Apart from cooking, I also enjoy drawing in my spare time. However, each drawing I make tends to take quite a long time, so lately I haven't been drawing much at all.</dd>
